### DOG-API PROJECT

The idea behind this gallery of doggies is to explore and enjoy the resources of the API while learning key concepts of web development. This project was created with the aim of deepening my understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript and learning to interact with REST APIs. To achieve this, I decided to use the API from https://thedogapi.com and the Tailwind CSS framework to design a fun and dynamic interface.
